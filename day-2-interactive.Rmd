```

## Derivatives in R

```{r}
fx <- expression(x^2)

df_dx <- D(expr = fx, name = 'x')

df_dx

# Evaluate slope of f(x) at x=831

x <- seq(from = -10, to = 10, by = 0.5)

eval(expr = df_dx)

```

```{r}
gt <- expression(3 * t ^ 2 - 4 * cos(t))

dg_dt <- D(expr = gt, name= 't')

dg_dt
```

### trying on my own

```{r}


fa <- expression(4* a ^2 + 5)

a = 7

df_da <- D(expr = fa, name = 'a')



eval(exp = df_da)

```
